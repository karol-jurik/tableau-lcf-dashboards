# UK Living Costs & Savings — Interactive BI Dashboards (Tableau)

Two-level Tableau dashboard suite (overview + drill-down) built to explore **regional differences in household income, expenditure and derived savings** in the UK.  
Designed for **stakeholder-friendly consumption** (fast overview) while enabling **deeper investigation** (drill-down).

## What this project demonstrates
- **BI dashboarding skills:** clear KPI layout, interactivity, drill-down structure, and usability-focused design.
- **Analytics mindset:** exploratory checks and robust reporting choices (see “Design choices” below).
- **Stakeholder-ready output:** published dashboards with a simple navigation flow (overview → detail).

## Design choices (why it’s built this way)
- **Two-level flow:** users start with a high-level regional view and then drill down for details.
- **Median-based KPIs:** chosen to reduce sensitivity to top-coding / outliers and make comparisons more robust.
- **Interactive filtering:** region selection drives the rest of the views to support focused exploration.

## Key features
- **UK region map** as an interactive filter
- **Income vs. expenditure** comparison and derived **savings**
- Drill-down slicing by household characteristics (e.g., household size / number of children)

## About the data
UK Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) dataset used for educational/portfolio purposes.

## Transferable skills
Built in Tableau, but the same principles apply to **Power BI** and other BI tools: KPI consistency, data modelling mindset, interactive exploration, and reliable/robust metrics.
