# UK Living Costs & Savings — Tableau Dashboards (Overview + Drill-Down)

Interactive BI dashboard suite built in **Tableau** using the **UK Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF)** dataset.  
The project focuses on clear KPI definitions, regional comparison, and drill-down exploration for stakeholder-friendly analysis.

## Dashboards
- **Primary (Overview):** regional view with interactive filtering

- **Secondary (Drill-down):** deeper exploration and comparisons

## Key ideas / design choices
- Built as a **two-level dashboard flow**: overview → drill-down.
- Used **median-based KPIs** to reduce sensitivity to top-coding / outliers and provide more robust reporting.
- Emphasis on **decision-ready layout**: fast scanning of key metrics + interactive exploration when needed.

## Features
- **UK region map** as an interactive filter for the rest of the views
- Comparison of **income vs expenditure** and derived **savings** across regions
- Drill-down slicing by household characteristics (e.g., household size / children)

## Notes
This is a portfolio project (Tableau). The same dashboarding principles (data modeling mindset, KPI consistency, and usability) are transferable to other BI tools.
